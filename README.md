# YOLO-Video-Image-Dataset-Scraper

Ongoing effort to use YOLO for generating image datasets from videos.

Works by partitioning a video into frames then classifying them with YOLO.

The long term goal is to be able to query a specific item with a list of videos, and procure every frame containing said item in a resultant picture dataset.

Looking to incorporate additional neural networks into this process for learning "better quality" images over others. Also looking to expand beyond the current YOLO dictionary of items.
